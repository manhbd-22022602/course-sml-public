When called with no arguments it opens an interactive help session. When called with a specific object as an argument, it displays the documentation for that object. For example, you can use *help(print)* to view the documentation for the built-in print function, or *help(str)* to view the documentation for the str class. Additionally, you can use the *dir()*-function to get all methods and properties of the object passed as an argument to it. It can be used to check all the attributes of a module or class. For example, *dir(str)* will give the methods and properties of the str class.\n\n\n#### SHIFT + TAB\n\nIn Jupyter notebook, *shift+tab* is a keyboard shortcut that can be used to access the documentation for the function or object that appears immediately before the cursor. When you press *shift+tab*, a small pop-up window will appear that contains information about the function or object, including its arguments and their types. Pressing *shift+tab* multiple times will cycle through different levels of documentation. If nothing is selected it will show the tip of the current cell.

Numpy arrays are often initialized from regular Python lists. For example, the Python list [1, 2, 3] can be converted into a 1D numpy array using the command np.array([1, 2, 3]). Create this numpy array in the cell below and print its shape. You can find the shape of a numpy array A using *np.shape(A)*.\n\nYou can create 1D arrays with n elements using for example np.zeros(n), np.ones(n), np.arange(a, b), np.random.rand(n), np.linspace(a, b, n)... Try this out and figure out what the different functions do.\n\n### (b)\n\nSimilarly, a 2D numpy array can be created from a nested Python list (a list of lists). Convert the nested lists [ [1, 2, 3] ] and [ [1], [2], [3] ] into numpy arrays and print their shapes. Which one represents a column vector, and which one represents a row vector?\n\n### (c)\n\nCreate a 2D numpy array to represent the matrix E and inspect its shape.\n$$\n\\textbf{E} =  \\begin{bmatrix}\n        1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n        4 & 5 & 6 \\\\\n        7 & 8 & 9 \\\\\n        10 & 11 & 12 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nWe can create higher dimensional *ndarrays*. in a similar way. You can create ndarrays of shape (n, m) using for example np.zeros((n, m)), np.ones((n, m), np.random.rand(n, m). You can also use np.eye(n) to create a diagonal matrix of shape (n,n).

Make sure you understand how to index and slice numpy arrays of different dimensions.\n\n### (e)\nIt is also easy to assign new values to specific elements or entire rows and columns of numpy arrays.

This can be done using the function *np.reshape(H, (n, m))*, where (n, m) is the desired shape of the array. Alternatively, we can write *H.reshape(n, m)*. Convert the array H given below into 2D arrays of different shapes (n,m) and inspect the result. What is the requirement on n and m? Can you use the reshape-function to convert H into a column vector and a row vector?\n\n### (g)\nIf we want to reshape a 1D array into a column- or row vector and we do not know the size of the array, we can use -1 in place of the unknown size, i.e. *np.reshape(array, -1, 1)*. Use this method to convert the array M into a column- and a row vector, and confirm the dimensions using np.shape().\n\nWe can also use *np.newaxis* to expand the dimension of an array M: M2 = M[*np.newaxis*, :]. Use this method to convert the array M into a column and a row vector as well. This can be important for example when a function requires a 2D array and you have access to your data in a 1D array.\n\n### (h)\nWe can also stack numpy arrays to create new arrays, using for example *np.vstack() and np.hstack()*. In the example below, F and G are stacked vertically and horizontally. Inspect the results to understand how to stack numpy arrays. Then, create a new array X and add a row and a column of ones using the appropriate functions. Let X be a 3x3 diagonal matrix with 4's along the diagonal. Confirm the shape of the resulting array.

For example, you can find the minimum and maximum element of a numpy array z using *np.min(z)* and *np.max(z)*. If z is a matrix, you can find the minimum and maximum across rows and columns (i.e. across each *axis* of the 2D array) using *np.min(z, axis=0)* and *np.max(z, axis=1)*. You can also find the sum of an entire array, or the sum across columns or rows, using *np.sum()*. Find the minimum and maximum element of the matrix Z defined below, as well as the sum across the columns of the matrix.\n$$\n\\textbf{Z} =  \\begin{bmatrix}\n        10 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n        1 & 11 & 1 \\\\\n        2 & 2 & 12 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\n### (j)\nArithmetic operations on numpy arrays are straightforward. For example, you may add two arrays A and B of appropriate size simply through *A+B*, or *np.add(A, B)*. Many useful linear algebra operations are also available in numpy. For example, you can find the transpose of a matrix Z defined as a numpy array using *np.linalg.transpose(Z)* (or simply *Z.T*). You can find the inverse using *np.linalg.inv(Z)*. Matrix multiplication of two matrices A and B can be performed using *np.matmul(A, B)* (or simply A@B, where the @-operator implements np.matmul). Note that $A*B$ returns the elementwise multiplication of A and B.\n\nAnother useful function is the linear system solver. A linear system of the form $Z\\cdot x=b$ can be solved efficiently using np.linalg.solve($Z$, $b$). Solve the following linear system both using the matrix inverse and np.linalg.solve:\n\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n        10 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n        1 & 11 & 1 \\\\\n        2 & 2 & 12 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix} x =  \\begin{bmatrix}\n        2\\\\\n        1\\\\\n        10\\\\\n        3\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$"}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {"pycharm": {"name": "#%%\n"}, "tags": []}, "outputs": [], "source": "# enter your code here\n"}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {"pycharm": {"name": "#%% md\n"}, "tags": []}, "source": "# 0.2 Pandas Fundamentals\n\nPandas dataframes can be used to store data tables, and contains functionality to analyze, explore and manipulate the data in these tables.

Run the cell below to load the dataset and store it in a pandas dataframe called 'Auto'. We also print the number of rows and columns in the dataset. The dataset contains information about a number of vehicles. The following features are observed:\n\n- `mpg`: miles per gallon\n- `cylinders`: Number of cylinders between 4 and 8\n- `displacement`: Engine displacement (cu. inches)\n- `horsepower`: Engine horsepower\n- `weight`: Vehicle weight (lbs.)\n- `acceleration`: Time to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph (sec.)\n- `year`: Model year (modulo 100)\n- `origin`: Origin of car (1. American, 2. European, 3. Japanese)\n- `name`: Vehicle name\n\nTo get an overview of the data, we can use the commands Auto.info(). Using Auto.describe() we get summaries of some important statistics for each column in the dataset. With Auto.head() we can take a look at the first five rows of the data.
